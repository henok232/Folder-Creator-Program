# Folder-Creator-Program

This is a simple Python GUI application built with Tkinter that allows users to create multiple folders using a single input.

The user enters the number of folders to generate, and the program automatically creates them in sequence. For safety and system stability, the maximum limit is set to 100 folders, and invalid inputs (such as strings or negative numbers) are properly handled.

This project demonstrates:

Input validation

Loop logic

File system interaction using the os module

Basic GUI development with Tkinter

Defensive programming practices

I built this project to deepen my understanding of how Python interacts with the operating system while keeping the application safe and controlled
